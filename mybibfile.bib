abstract = {A new active target named MAIKo (Mu-PIC based Active target for Inverse Kinematics∘) has been developed at Kyoto University and Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Osaka University. MAIKo is suited for missing-mass spectroscopy of unstable nuclei at forward scattering angles in inverse kinematics. MAIKo consists of a time projection chamber (TPC), which incorporates a micro-pixel chamber ($\mu$-PIC) as the electron multiplication and collection system. In MAIKo, the medium gas also plays the role of a reaction target, thus allowing detection of low-energy recoil particles with high position resolution. The MAIKo TPC was commissioned with He(93{\%})+iso-C4H10(7{\%}) and He(93{\%})+CO2(7{\%}) mixture gasses at 430 hPa. The gas gain and the angular resolution of MAIKo were evaluated with an alpha source and a 4He beam at 56 MeV. The TPC was stably operated up to 1000-kcps beam intensity. A tracking algorithm using the Hough transform method has been developed to analyze scattering events. An angular resolution of 1.3°was achieved for scattered 4He particles.},

abstract = {In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3×3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16–19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisa- tion and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facili- tate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision. 1},

This detector consists of double sided printing circuit board (PCB). The stable operation of Micro PIC is realized by thick substrate and wide anode strips. One of the most outstanding feature is the process of production and the cost. The base technology of producing Micro PIC is same as producing PCB, then detector with large detection area (more than 10 cm × 10 cm) can be made by present technology. Our first tests were performed using a 3 cm × 3 cm detection area with a readout of 0.4 mm pitch. The gas gain and stability were measured in these tests. The gas gain of 104 was obtained using argon ethane (8:2) gas mixture. Also, there was no discharge between anodes and cathodes in the gain of 103 during two days of continuous operation. Although some discharges occurred in the higher gain (approximately 104), no critical damage on the detector was found. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

In our measurement, a superior S/N ratio, high angular/energy resolutions and a wide detection energy range were realized with a pencil DT neutron beam and a countertelescope system. The obtained cross section for the 12 C(n, $\alpha$ 0 ) 9 Be( ground state ) reaction agreed well with the results of previous experiments and evaluated nuclear data. The obtained angular-differential cross section of the 12 C(n, n′+3$\alpha$) reaction for $\alpha$-particles showed a strong forward-peaked distribution that suggested a significant contribution of the direct reaction process to the 3a breakup. We attempted to calculate the emitted particle spectra by a Monte Carlo method and estimate the branching ratio of the channels that contribute to the 12 C(n,n′+3$\alpha$) reaction. As a result, it was found that the 12 C(n,$\alpha$) 9 Be* channels play an important role in generating the experimental double-differential cross section both of emitted $\alpha$-particles and neutrons. The estimated ratio of the 12 C(n,$\alpha$) 9 Be* channels was approximately 40{\%}, somewhat larger than those evaluated in previous studies. {\textcopyright} Atomic Energy Society of Japan.},

abstract = {The present paper aims to show that the abundances of the chemical elements over the portion of the periodic table from carbon to nickel are consistent with the view that the elements originate at the high temperatures that probably occur in the interiors of cerntain types of star. The argument takes its most definite form in the discusstion of the synthesis of elements below sodium, where it seems that the abundances are in fairly close accord with the known properies of the various nuclei. For sodium and heavier elements sufficiently precise nuclear data are not available, and hence the argument becomes more qualitative than quantitative. Nevertheless, the general nature of the agreement between calculation and observation for these latter nuclei makes the discussion of them worth presenting. The early parts of the paper are concerned with the relation to cosmogony of the theory of the orifin of the elements.},

@article{SRIM,
abstract = {SRIM is a software package concerning the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter. Since its introduction in 1985, major upgrades are made about every six years. Currently, more than 700 scientific citations are made to SRIM every year. For SRIM-2010, the following major improvements have been made: (1) About 2800 new experimental stopping powers were added to the database, increasing it to over 28,000 stopping values. (2) Improved corrections were made for the stopping of ions in compounds. (3) New heavy ion stopping calculations have led to significant improvements on SRIM stopping accuracy. (4) A self-contained SRIM module has been included to allow SRIM stopping and range values to be controlled and read by other software applications. (5) Individual interatomic potentials have been included for all ion/atom collisions, and these potentials are now included in the SRIM package. A full catalog of stopping power plots can be downloaded at www.SRIM.org. Over 500 plots show the accuracy of the stopping and ranges produced by SRIM along with 27,000 experimental data points. References to the citations which reported the experimental data are included.},

@article{active-tpc,
  abstract = {Weakly bound nuclear systems can be considered to represent a good testing-ground of our understanding of non-perturbative quantum systems. Reactions leading to bound and unbound states in systems with very unbalanced neutron-to-proton ratios are used to understand the properties of these systems. Radioactive beams with energies from below the Coulomb barrier up to several hundreds MeV/nucleon are now available, and with these beams, a broad variety of studies of nuclei near the drip-line can be performed. To compensate for the low intensity of secondary beams as compared to primary beams, thick targets and high efficiency detection is necessary. In this context, a new generation of detectors was developed, called active target detectors: the detector gas is used as target, and the determination of the reaction vertex in three dimensions allows for good resolution even with thick targets. The reaction products can be measured over essentially 4$\pi$. The physics explored with these detectors together with the technology developed will be described.},
